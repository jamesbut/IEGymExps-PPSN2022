# Generative Models over Neural Controllers for Transfer Learning, PPSN 2022

This is the code used to generate the results in 'Generative Models over Neural Controllers for Transfer Learning', submitted to PPSN 2022. It consists of the evolutionary algorithm library DEAP optimising the weights of PyTorch neural network controllers on OpenAI gym environments. It has additional support for training AutoEncoders, VAEs and GANs and then using the generative part of each of these models as an indirect encoding in a subsequent evolutionary run.

### Build

docker-compose has been used to build and run
